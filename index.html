        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">Nice to meet you! I'm Vinnie, I was on the IAG Tech Graduate scheme and have now joined Aer Lingus as a junior data scientist in their IT People and Finance team where I maintain apps and build dashboards. As of 3 months ago, I live in Bedford, which is about an hour up the M1 from London. It's close to Luton, which is very useful for catching flights to Dublin (where my office is).</p>

          <h3>Running</h3>
          <p>I started running a few years ago, and regularly do Parkrun (a 5k weekly run organised across the country) on Saturday mornings. I've run three FULL Marathons (Richmond 2022, Brighton 2023, and London 2024) and one half marathon (Stanwick Lakes 2022). There is still room for improvement but I'd say I'm a pretty good runner!</p>

          <h3>Languages</h3>
          <p>I grew up in Germany and went to international schools there so I learnt english as well as german. I did french at school and am now attempting to learn spanish in preparation for my holiday to Seville later this year. I also did a year abroad in Denmark where I picked up a little bit of danish.</p>
